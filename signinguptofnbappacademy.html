    <h1>Signing Up To FNB App Academy</h1>
    <p>Hi</p>
    <p>
      So you're here because you've heard about the fnb app academy and want to
      sign up. Applications have closed, however, the curriculum has been made
      public so you can still learn to code alongside this year's cohort. Follow
      these steps and you should be set!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fill in
      <a
        href="https://itvarsity.mailchimpsites.com/fnb-app-academy-25"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >the form on the IT varsity website</a
      >
      and come back here when you are done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've submitted your registration form you need to go to the sign-in
      page and click on "forgot password" then fill in the email you used to
      register. IT varsity will then send you an email so you can set a passowrd
      and log in.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are experiencing problems with re-setting your password, check
      that:
    </p>
    <li>
      <ul>
        the email for resetting the passowrd is not in your spam folder
      </ul>
      <ul>
        you've only filled in the email portion and the other one is empty
      </ul>
    </li>
    <p>You will now receive the lessons delivered to your email inbox.</p>
    <p>
      Once you have access to the lessons, you can start coding. The lessons are
      designed to be self-paced, so you can take your time to understand each
      concept before moving on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, coding is a journey, and it's okay to take your time. Don't rush
      through the lessons. Make sure you understand each concept before moving
      on to the next one.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or need help, you can reach out to the FNB App
      Academy team through their support channels. They are there to help you
      succeed.
    </p>
    <p>Good luck on your coding journey!</p>
