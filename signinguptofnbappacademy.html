    <h1>Signing Up To FNB App Academy</h1>
    <p>Hi</p>
    <p>So you're here because you've heard about the fnb app academy and want to sign up. Applications have closed, however, the curriculum has been made public so you can still learn to code alongside this year's cohort. Follow these steps and you should be set!</p>
    <p>Fill in <a href="https://itvarsity.mailchimpsites.com/fnb-app-academy-25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the form on the IT varsity website</a> and come back here when you are done.</p>
    <p>Once you've submitted your registration form you need to go to the sign-in page and click on "forgot password" then fill in the email you used to register. IT varsity will then send you an email so you can set a passowrd and log in.</p>
    <p>If you are experiencing problems with re-setting your password, check that:</p>
    <li>
        <ul>the email for resetting the passowrd is not in your spam folder</ul>
        <ul>you've only filled in the email portion and the other one is empty</ul>
    </li>
    <p>You will now receive the lessons delivered to your email inbox.</p>
