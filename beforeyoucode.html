    <h1>Before You Code</h1>
    <p>
      It is possible to start coding immediately, in-fact that's where most
      courses or bootcamps begin. But coding is hard and if you don't prepare
      properly you will get overwhelmed and quit too soon. So this page is about
      preparation.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Get Okay With Tech</h2>
    <p>
      You need to make sure that you are comfortable with and relatively safe on
      your devices. That means taking a basic computer course.

        >Microsoft and LinkedIn have a free course</a
      >
      that comes with a certificate of completion.
    </p>
    <h2>The Language Thing</h2>
    <p>
      Then, there's the language thing. See you have to accept that the western
      world of coding is english-based. All of the courses, documentation and
      most tutorials will be in english. This is not to discourage you, this is
      so that you can prepare yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can prepare yourself by getting comfortable with reading and writing
      in English. Looking up coding tutorials in the language you are most
      fluent in will also help but improving fluency in reading and writing in
      English is something you have to do. Being able to code means that you can
      read documentation to learn anything. Most of this documentation is also
      heavy in jargon, so looking up the meaning of words is something you will
      have to become comfortable with.
    </p>
    <h2>Look It Up</h2>
    <p>
      Seriously, you have to look things up. If you are confused spend more time
      and do not move on until you understand. Ask the internet. Make
      <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> and
      <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions">stackoverflow</a> your
      friends. Depend on them by looking things up, researching things, using
      them as tools. Research skills are vital in your coding journey - they are
      important in life - but for you to become successful at learning to code
      and then coding professionally you must know how to research various
      topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coding is a type of problem-solving. It is using computational technology
      to solve real world problems. So though you've decided to learn how to
      code, understand that in doing so you have also decided learn how to be a
      problem-solver. To solve a problem I must understand the problem and, to
      understand the problem I must know how to research.
    </p>
    <h2>It's All In Your Head</h2>
    <p>
      The foundational skill of anything in life is knowing exactly what it is
      and that it can happen - that is about your headspace. Your headspace is
      so important in all of this. You will get overwhelmed. You will get tired.
      You will want to quit. Your ability to keep going is so important for
      learning. There is a lot out there about growth mindset, I will not get
      into it. I will just recommend a YouTube playlist.

    <h2>The Struggle Is Real</h2>
    <p>
      Programming is difficult but that is not enough of a reason to quit. It is
      supposed to be difficult because there will always be a new problem that
      you can try solving with code.So you must be reasonable about your
      expectations. You must be reasonable while being persistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not giving up works. That's why building the right mindset is important
      and worthwhile. You need to keep learning and building. Yet, you will
      still feel like you are faking it. It is normal to feel like you are
      faking it. That is proof that you've been learning this whole time - it is
      proof that you have learnt enough to know what's good work vs what's not.
      So keep going. Using this improved taste-level in your learning is what
      will make you the programmer you want to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      So remember this when it gets hard - it is supposed to get hard. It is
      hard because you are on the right track so, keep going.
